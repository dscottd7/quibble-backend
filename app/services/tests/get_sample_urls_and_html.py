It’s a perfect and stylish addition to a classically styled or vintage bike. I bought one for my wife and liked it so much I bought a second for my new bike build installation is a bit fiddly, just take your time. I was concerned about the metal attaching strap scratching my handlebar but it includes a thick rubber strip that you can wrap around the bar before installing. Best advice is to pre-bend the strap a bit to fit your handlebar. Hold the strap from below the bar with one hand and slide the bell into place with the other hand. The trick is getting the ends of the strap to go into two small slots under the bell. Fiddle with it for a minute and you’ll see how it goes together screw on top pushes the inside of the bell down against the bar and takes up slack in the strap. Use the included hex wrench to tighten carefully. Ding the bell several times as you tighten - at some point you will over-tighten it and it won’t ring clearly- then just back off a bit tone of the bell is loud, clear and long.

I like the way it installs, but it may be a little difficult for some people to install. May need a friend to help. Read more Helpful Report RayNan4 out of 5 stars Very Similar to More Expensive VARIETY. Nice sound! Instructions in review... Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2024Color: Golden 1Verified Purchase This is a detailed review. I am able to compare this bell to the more expensive variety, that I also own. While I haven't gone biking with the bell yet, I anticipate it will work similar to the more expensive variety. The bell is good and loud and somewhat shrill. But it will do the trick of warning people to get out of the way!.Installation. Many have commented that there are no instructions. Correct. That's why I dinged this one star. However, there is a video that should be quite helpful. It took me about 10 minutes to get this done. I had to use the longer band for my handlebar. To reduce the anxiety of installation, I reco to insert one end of the band into the bell before you start. Position the bell on the handlebar such that you can see the other insertion point for the band. Holding the bell in place, wrap the band around the handlebar and squeeze/push the open end-ended band into the other insertion point. The bell should be fitting loosely but is stably attached to the handlebar. At ths point I applied the silicone strip to the handlebar. I only used half the length for 2 reasons. First, If I used all of it, it became difficult to slide the bell over the strip. Second, you don't need much to protect the handlebar from the band that is in contact. With this in mind, I was able to slide the bell over the strip. After tightening the bell, I got a nice ring from the hammer. However, I noticed that with repeated use, the hammer would not strike the bell. It appeared the hammer spring was the problem. A little WD40 fixed this nicely. The sound is quite similar to the more expensive variety.Net, this RockBros bell is quite nice with a loud ring. The lack of instructions is unfortunate but not a show stopper. You might need some WD40 to get the hammer to strike the bell all the time. As you're spending 15-25% of the cost of the original model, this a V Good Deal indeed!

Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024Color: BlackVerified Purchase It sounds great and the price is unbeatable. The sound isn’t quite as good as it’s much more expensive competition, but unless you’re audiophile - there’s no reason to spend the additional money.P. it’s worth mentioning that it has a similar annoying and difficult mounting mechanism.

(We have 3, one of which is the version 2 of these bells, and I'm about to order one more.) The version 2 has a smaller and slightly quieter bell, but it's still loud enough. I like how they're made with metal and some rubber bumpers. Though they're hard to install, the set up allows these to fit in tight spaces between handlebars and gear/brake levers, which is a nice feature that few other bells have. The only other one I've seen (and also have) that gets close to fitting in as tight of spots uses a rubber ring to attach the bell, but you can't get the fit as tight, so it rotates a bit, and it's very easy to steal. No tools required! The sound of the bell isn't as pretty as some, but that slight harshness also makes the bell more effective at getting people's attention, which I like. I didn't get this bell to perform in an orchestra.

This one fits using the larger metal piece (comes with one large and one small).Install was medium difficulty using instructions on the listing. No instructions come in the box. Medium difficulty install because it was tedious - metal band difficult to bend and you have to center it perfectly on this rubber adhesive strip they send with the bell to keep it from marring your handle bars.Sound of the bell isn’t pleasant. I used to have a more classic bell with a charming friendly ring. This one is loud but also quite shrill. I’ll probably scare people out of the way on mixed use trails. J/K… kinda’… :) I included a video for reference.Once installed it is quite stable. Be sure not to over tighten it, or it could dampen the bell ring. You have to install it to really hear it properly.For the cost, it does the job and looks decent. I like that it’s small. Wish the Knog OI bell fit my bars better and felt higher quality. This one seems like it will last a lot longer than the Knog but only time will tell.

I have owned a few Spur Cycle bells and I can tell you they are very, very nice. If you like nice things that are thoughtfully engineered, manufactured to high standards, that last a long time and develop an attractive patina, then you should get the Spur Cycle bell. This inexpensive bell looks very similar, and it basically functions as a bell. It's not as loud, it doesn't produce a clear and beautiful tone, and it's not as easy to install but it gets the job done.
